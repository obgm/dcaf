ABOUT DCAF
==========

The Delegated CoAP Authentication and Authorization Framework (DCAF)
defines an architecture and a protocol for delegating client
authentication and authorization in a constrained environment for
establishing a secure communication context between
resource-constrained nodes, utilizing Datagram Transport Layer
Security (DTLS) or CBOR message syntax (COSE). 

The protocol transfers authorization information and shared secrets
for symmetric cryptography between entities in a constrained
network. A resource-constrained node can use the protocol to delegate
authentication of communication peers and management of authorization
information to a trusted host with less severe limitations regarding
processing power and memory.
